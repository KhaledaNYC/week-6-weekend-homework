# Labor Day Weekend Homework

Just what you wanted to do this Labor Day!

## Part 0: Self Reflection 

Please fill out the self reflection [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdL7UEZwVberai5edKSiX6nkGPTIm1biIDATHUV7cGULxYfPA/viewform). This is a time to reflect on all of the awesome stuff you've learned this week.

## Part I: Independent Rails Project

You'll spend this weekend constructing a small Rails project independently--no pairs this time! Though of course you can and should reach out to classmates for support, this project is yours alone. 

### Requirements

* 3 models with one join table
* Minimum of one nested form
* Minimum of one AJAX-ified form. In other words, one of your forms should be submitted via AJAX, and you should use jQuery to change the appearance of the page upon receiving a successful response from you AJAX request.
